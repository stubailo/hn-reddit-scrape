The group I am working for secured a nice sized loan to help start a business/art/tech incubator in the area and hired me to  coordinate the office space. \n\nHere's my question/what I need help with: I've never coordinated an incubator before. We have NO clientele right now and literally are starting from scratch in hopes that our incubator space will spur more business and economic growth for the area. \n\nWhere do we start?
