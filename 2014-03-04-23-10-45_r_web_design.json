I also studied various design principles like color theory, user experience etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When i look back i can say that i learned quite a lot and i feel good about it.

But the moment i start thinking about actually putting myself out there in hopes of getting some real world websites to make all of my confidence drops to the ground.

I simply feel like i made myself think that i know how to do this but in reality i&amp;#39;m incompetent and a fraud, and i think that if someone contacted me and wanted me to make them a site i would run away and disappear.
