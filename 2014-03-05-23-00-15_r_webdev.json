I have almost nine years in Photoshop/ACS. I know all about CMS including Wordpress, Joomla and Expression Engine. I can write basic vanilla JavaScript and PHP from scratch and I&amp;#39;m excellent at debugging/modifying it. I work with MySQL databases on a daily basis and can write queries all day long. With more complex PHP/JS scripts I can usually figure out what I&amp;#39;m doing with a little Googling. I get version control, FTP, Bootstrap and a couple frameworks.

I&amp;#39;m excellent in SEO and have proof of my results. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have much office experience but I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what I&amp;#39;m doing - which is why I keep applying for entry level jobs. The most I&amp;#39;ve been offered so far is 32k with a dozen asterisks attached (Contract basis, starting part time, ineligible for a raise for the first year.) but like I said, I just can&amp;#39;t afford to go into the city on a daily basis for that. I&amp;#39;m a lightning fast learner. I&amp;#39;m personable, polished, flexible and friendly though I&amp;#39;m a little shy. All of the developers I have been interviewing with, though they&amp;#39;ve almost exclusively been very nice, aren&amp;#39;t very personable. At least with strangers.

I couldn&amp;#39;t get a word in edgewise so I dropped it. This isn&amp;#39;t for web design or something in the UI/UX realm - they&amp;#39;re asking for front end &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; as much back end as possible. They want me to do client work so I imagine they&amp;#39;re easily making 10k+ per site. They kept calling the position entry level, but they didn&amp;#39;t seem to be impressed when some of my skills (JS/PHP) actually were entry level. Of 300+ applications, only three of us were interviewed so they must have liked my code and design skills. But they&amp;#39;re not willing to pay me even market rate? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I initially started interviewing, I thought I had just run into some bad luck.
