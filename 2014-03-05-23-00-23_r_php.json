Is there a way of searching this dictionary for anagrams of a string, *without* simply looping through *every* single word in the dictionary, which would be incredibly inefficient?\n\nI'm failing to come up with an idea. There's many anagram solvers out there, do they all just do what I described above or is there a more efficient way of achieving this? If they do do what I described above, how do they manage to do it so quickly?\n\nThanks.", "likes": null, "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1zkcfq", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "author": "HopeIsImportant", "media": null, "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh38", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 1, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/PHP/comments/1zkcfq/fastest_way_of_finding_anagrams_of_a_string/", "name": "t3_1zkcfq", "created": 1393996808.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/1zkcfq/fastest_way_of_finding_anagrams_of_a_string/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "Fastest way of finding anagrams of a string", "created_utc": 1393968008.0, "ups": 6, "num_comments": 4, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "github.com", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "PHP", "selftext_html": null, "selftext": "", "likes": null, "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1zix9k", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "author": "_query", "media": null, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh38", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "saved": false, "is_self": false, "permalink": "/r/PHP/comments/1zix9k/github_api_client_feedback_welcome/", "name": "t3_1zix9k", "created": 1393966660.0, "url": "https://github.com/mpscholten/github-api", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "Github Api Client - Feedback welcome", "created_utc": 1393937860.0, "ups": 6, "num_comments": 17, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "blog.pop.co", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "PHP", "selftext_html": null, "selftext": "", "likes": null, "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1zj6eg", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "author": "jqueryin", "media": null, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh38", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "saved": false, "is_self": false, "permalink": "/r/PHP/comments/1zj6eg/why_we_rolled_our_own_ab_testing_tool_at_pop/", "name": "t3_1zj6eg", "created": 1393973900.0, "url": "http://blog.pop.co/post/78547853602/why-we-rolled-our-own-ab-testing-tool-at-pop", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "Why we rolled our own AB testing tool at POP", "created_utc": 1393945100.0, "ups": 4, "num_comments": 1, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "pastebin.com", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "PHP", "selftext_html": null, "selftext": "", "likes": null, "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1zg66x", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "author": "dontforgetpassword", "media": null, "score": 126, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh38", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 30, "saved": false, "is_self": false, "permalink": "/r/PHP/comments/1zg66x/lets_play_spot_the_bugs_in_mtgox_leaked_source/", "name": "t3_1zg66x", "created": 1393897468.0, "url": "http://pastebin.com/W8B3CGiN", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "Let's play spot the bugs in Mt.Gox Leaked Source Code", "created_utc": 1393868668.0, "ups": 156, "num_comments": 166, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.PHP", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "PHP", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand (probably not) the scope of a class, but something is missing on how to effectively use them.
