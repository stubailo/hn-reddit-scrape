In the next two months I plan on building a portfilo of a few dumby sites I plan to build combining all that I've learned.\nI also plan on start looking for some open source to get involved in and freebie work for the experience.\nSo, my questions are; 1) what's the best appraoch to finding some open source projects 2) Where can I begin to look for jobs besides Careerbuilder, Monster, and Indeed 3) What feed back can you give me about my approach and what should I add to my action plan.\n\nIf you have any questions about exactly what've done and or details about my plan, please ask.", "likes": null, "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1zoqr0", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "author": "2014devgoal", "media": null, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs0q", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 1, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/webdev/comments/1zoqr0/web_developer_job_search_question/", "name": "t3_1zoqr0", "created": 1394104086.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1zoqr0/web_developer_job_search_question/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "Web developer job search question", "created_utc": 1394075286.0, "ups": 2, "num_comments": 0, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "richardtier.com", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "webdev", "selftext_html": null, "selftext": "", "likes": null, "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1zohmd", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "author": "rikAtee", "media": null, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "http://c.thumbs.redditmedia.com/gUvv-eb-E87Zz3xb.jpg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs0q", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 1, "saved": false, "is_self": false, "permalink": "/r/webdev/comments/1zohmd/check_username_and_password_using_django_rest/", "name": "t3_1zohmd", "created": 1394098315.0, "url": "http://richardtier.com/2014/03/06/110/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "Check username and password using Django Rest Framework.
