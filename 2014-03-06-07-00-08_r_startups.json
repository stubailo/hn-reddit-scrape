I really want this to be as simple as possible as well as free for anyone who chooses to use it.\n\nThe main feature of this app is that when putting together a group list, any user can add or check off each item/task (with the admins having the ability to add users or remove items). \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wRK5CA5.jpg\n\nEach task/item will have a feature to chat about it which would be especially useful if an item is vague or generic.\n\nI've worked with a designer to get this mock up but I still have a ways to go. I am currently looking to release this for iOS and in need of a developer so if anyone has or knows someone who would like to speak with me on being a co founder, please feel free to ask!\n\nAnother question I have is that since I am not that technical, would the features I have listed require a significant amount of capital in upfront costs and ongoing running costs? \n\nI'll be on here for a while as I'd really like to chat with you guys!
