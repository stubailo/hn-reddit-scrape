Our tagline is that &amp;quot;We foster style for the urban beardsman.&amp;quot; Many startup companies focus on selling their products, but they neglect building their brand. While simply selling is difficult, it&amp;#39;s still easier than creating a brand. This guide shows how we are building a brand with Beardbrand and what you should focus on. Keep in mind that not all businesses need to build a brand, but if you are B2C company it should be a pretty high priority.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages of building a brand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Customers will be more loyal&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Your products can carry a higher price point&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Word of mouth marketing / viral marketing is more common&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Valuation of your company will be higher (One example: the US company Electrolux sold their brand and nothing else to the Sweedish Electrolux. Their new brand is now known as &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerus_LLC\"&gt;Aerus&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages of building a brand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s more expensive&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s a longer strategy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Must invest in more company culture to ensure brand is not tarnished&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Return on investment is not as clear as call to action marketing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A tarnished brand loses all the hardwork you&amp;#39;ve done to build it up&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Start&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First you will want to commit to building a brand, and all the challenges that presents. You will have to be prepared to say &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; and stick to your guns. Inconsistency is the death to brands. Spend a lot of time up front to truly understand what you want to be and how you want to present your company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With Beardbrand we developed the term &amp;quot;urban beardsman&amp;quot; which describes a man with a beard who cares about their style, their grooming habits, and who has a plan and a vision with their personal life. Traditionally beardsmen were thought of as hippies, bikers, outdoorsmen, or homeless folks. We wanted to unite people who didn&amp;#39;t feel like they fit those labels. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To get this rolling we place an emphasis on design and branding. Our logo is simple and clean. Our primary colors are black and white and secondary color is cyan. We have had our tagline front and center on our store since we created it. Fortunately, I am a self taught designer and have implemented a lot of our designs. If you do not have those skills, you will need to invest in a quality designer. Most likely you won&amp;#39;t find those at Fiverr, 99 designs, or any of those spec work places. Try instead to search for them via Dribbble, &lt;a href=\"/r/graphic_design\"&gt;/r/graphic_design&lt;/a&gt;, your local AIGA club, or other places designers like to hang out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plan on establishing a relationship with a designer you can trust and work with. You&amp;#39;ll want to send all (or at least a majority of) your designs to them so that you create brand consistency. All designers have different styles, and like I said before; inconsistency a roadblock to building a quality brand. A good designer can also help you with brand guidelines to keep you and others on track. It&amp;#39;s essentially a blueprint on how to keep things consistent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Build&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First off, it&amp;#39;s important that you walk the walk. IE; the image you are trying to create of your brand is something you actually eat, drink, sleep and live. You&amp;#39;ll want to tie together your branding across all your channels. That means your actions, business cards, website, merchandise, advertisements, emails, marketing, etc must all be cohesive. To show you how we did it, here are a few elements Beardbrand has created.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.beardbrand.com\"&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.beardbrand.com/pages/beardbrand-vision\"&gt;Our Vision Page&lt;/a&gt; *very important for us&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eKg9GdDpQY\"&gt;Video of our vision&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/LbQstD4.jpg\"&gt;One of our ads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://dribbble.com/shots/1103944-Beardbrand-business-cards?list=show\"&gt;Business Cards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/kiUhjVMYAq/\"&gt;PR Kit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/9NTzzUe.jpg\"&gt;Mustache Wax Packaging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/3dLIedD.jpg\"&gt;Beard Oil Packaging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to your brand&amp;#39;s design and feel, your company also has a brand on how it performs. Based on our target audience, we decided to provide a premium experience to our customers. To us that means quality products, fast shipping, no hassle customer service, and no sales pressure. How this reflects on our business is that we are using premium oils that put beard care first, quality packaging, shipping within one business day, making things right with customers when things go wrong, and offer no discounts or sales on our store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we attend events, trade shows, or put on parties - then we carry the same attitude and image that we portray online. We try to be as friendly as possible, not pressure anyone into anything, and have a good time. There is more to life than just selling beard products.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sacrifices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We frequently get suggestions to do things differently. We are always have open ears (in fact made a lot of changes based on Reddit&amp;#39;s friendly advice) but sometimes we&amp;#39;ve got to say &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; and do it for the right reason (or at least you think they are right). Here are a couple of examples.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had multiple marketing professionals tell us that we need to put our products on sale. I stand by our viewpoint that our product is fantastic, and when people are ready to buy they will buy. Granted, we might be missing out on some opportunity; but we feel in the long run we prefer the culture of quality over immediate gratification. We use Nordstrom&amp;#39;s and Lululemon as inspiration.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We don&amp;#39;t put advertisements on our YouTube videos. We are approaching 1 million views and I&amp;#39;m sure I could have had a few thousand extra dollars, but it&amp;#39;s a more pleasureable experience not watching ads when people watch our videos.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We stick to style inspiration on Facebook. In a land of 10 day old internet memes, we could exponentially grow our user base by simply posting beard meme&amp;#39;s. While, it may slow us down in growth; it&amp;#39;s more important for us to accurately show we are about. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We market with no direct performance tracking. Some examples: We are putting a party on down in SXSW called &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1427271914180622\"&gt;SXBB&lt;/a&gt;. | We are buying ads that simply have photos of beardsmen and no call to action. | We are building an Ambassador program where we give out freebies to the select few beardsmen who really represent the image well. | Plus many other things.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We&amp;#39;ve spent way more on business cards, PR kits, and other items than your typical company&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In less than a year we went from $0 in sales to $120k/month in sales. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We have a higher repeat customer rate than industry average&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our 7k email list gets 46.6% open rate and 13% click rate&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our users gladly write reviews of their experiences and share it on social media&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Customers will tell us that they purchase from us because of our videos and our vision&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building our business is a very pleasant and enjoyable experience&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I tried to cover everything, but I&amp;#39;m sure I missed a lot.

Keep in mind that not all businesses need to build a brand, but if you are B2C company it should be a pretty high priority.\n\n**Advantages of building a brand**\n\n* Customers will be more loyal\n* Your products can carry a higher price point\n* Word of mouth marketing / viral marketing is more common\n* Valuation of your company will be higher (One example: the US company Electrolux sold their brand and nothing else to the Sweedish Electrolux. Their new brand is now known as [Aerus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerus_LLC).)\n\n**Disadvantages of building a brand**\n\n* It's more expensive\n* It's a longer strategy\n* Must invest in more company culture to ensure brand is not tarnished\n* Return on investment is not as clear as call to action marketing\n* A tarnished brand loses all the hardwork you've done to build it up\n\n**The Start**\n\nFirst you will want to commit to building a brand, and all the challenges that presents. You will have to be prepared to say \"no\" and stick to your guns. Inconsistency is the death to brands. Spend a lot of time up front to truly understand what you want to be and how you want to present your company.\n\nWith Beardbrand we developed the term \"urban beardsman\" which describes a man with a beard who cares about their style, their grooming habits, and who has a plan and a vision with their personal life.

I could potentially dropout if it became viable enough or just actually gain some real experience and learn something from the experience. I started by reading as many non-fiction books on business and marketing as I could, acquiring some library fees along the way. One book that really was the tipping point for me was The 4 Hour Workweek. It&amp;#39;s a little outdated but it provided for me a solid framework to start from. I learned that starting a health supplement company isn&amp;#39;t really as difficult as you would imagine, especially in the US. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To me, at least, the hardest part of starting a business is the doing part. To help motivate myself, I told as many people my plans to start a business so I felt compelled to produce results. I created a notebook using Evernote dedicated just for the business project I had in mind. It let me keep all my information organized, while at the same time, let me slowly chip away at reaching my goal.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first business idea was to create a supplement to increase your chance of lucid dreaming. While trying to make it, I ran into continuous problems that resulted in changes which made my business idea gradually worse. When I finally had to put money behind my idea, I couldn\u2019t go through with it because I knew that business was shit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Literally the same day I realized my idea was fruitless I stumbled on r/nootropics. Nootropics are basically supplements that improve mental performance. I had become semi familiar through products like Alpha Brain. I was also actually already using some supplements that I bought for lucid dreaming purposes to help improve my short term memory in preparation for tests. I read their FAQ and on it I discovered their most recommended stack which is 100 mg Caffeine and 200 mg of L-Theanine. The first thing I did was search to see if I could get it in a singular pill because I was too lazy to be buying the separate ingredients and encapsulate it myself. To my surprise, there were none, which I thought was weird. It was a perfect opportunity; it almost felt too convenient and obvious. There was even a post someone made on the subreddit basically asking if there was singular pill form that they could purchase. Seeing that there was a demand, I took the plunge and decided I would build it into a business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As someone in their early 20s, in school, I&amp;#39;m not exactly rolling in cash. So getting a good manufacturer that could work within my budget was important. I contacted a lot of manufacturers. A lot of them just didn&amp;#39;t work out or just didn&amp;#39;t fit within my budget. I finally found a manufacturer that gave me a crazy good deal, this is because they already had both of the product supplements in stock and didn&amp;#39;t have to go out of their way to purchase them. One skill that I cannot stress saved me thousands of dollars were my graphic design skills. Because of it, I was able to do all the necessary artwork for both the physical product and for my website. Wordpress, Woocommerce, and Shipwire are the foundations to my business that make it run really nicely and make it possible that I can run my business from the comfort of my room. I cannot say enough nice things about these companies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We officially launched in October on r/nootropics with this &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/1ngsjk/green_tea_focus_caffeine100mg_ltheanine200mg/\"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.
