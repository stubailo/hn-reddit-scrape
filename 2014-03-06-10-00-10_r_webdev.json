I have almost nine years in Photoshop/ACS. I know all about CMS including Wordpress, Joomla and Expression Engine. I can write basic vanilla JavaScript and PHP from scratch and I&amp;#39;m excellent at debugging/modifying it. I work with MySQL databases on a daily basis and can write queries all day long. With more complex PHP/JS scripts I can usually figure out what I&amp;#39;m doing with a little Googling. I get version control, FTP, Bootstrap and a couple frameworks. I&amp;#39;ve worked in major eCommerce platforms like Magento and Shopify. I&amp;#39;m excellent in SEO and have proof of my results. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have much office experience but I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what I&amp;#39;m doing - which is why I keep applying for entry level jobs. The most I&amp;#39;ve been offered so far is 32k with a dozen asterisks attached (Contract basis, starting part time, ineligible for a raise for the first year.) but like I said, I just can&amp;#39;t afford to go into the city on a daily basis for that. I&amp;#39;m a lightning fast learner. I&amp;#39;m personable, polished, flexible and friendly though I&amp;#39;m a little shy. All of the developers I have been interviewing with, though they&amp;#39;ve almost exclusively been very nice, aren&amp;#39;t very personable. At least with strangers. Again, I&amp;#39;m saying that as someone who considers themselves shy. I can find something in common with almost anyone and even crack a cute joke when it&amp;#39;s appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday I went in for an interview in the financial district and was told by the hiring manager, up front, that the most they would ever consider paying me was $30,000 - because &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s the average in New York&amp;quot; when I tried to point out that wasn&amp;#39;t true she continued to talk over me. I couldn&amp;#39;t get a word in edgewise so I dropped it. This isn&amp;#39;t for web design or something in the UI/UX realm - they&amp;#39;re asking for front end &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; as much back end as possible. They want me to do client work so I imagine they&amp;#39;re easily making 10k+ per site. They kept calling the position entry level, but they didn&amp;#39;t seem to be impressed when some of my skills (JS/PHP) actually were entry level. Of 300+ applications, only three of us were interviewed so they must have liked my code and design skills. But they&amp;#39;re not willing to pay me even market rate? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I initially started interviewing, I thought I had just run into some bad luck. It&amp;#39;s been three months now and ~12 interviews later...it&amp;#39;s starting to get ridiculous. It&amp;#39;s definitely a little more than discouraging. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t get it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I accidentally a word.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Basically, I can't afford to park my fucking car while I go into the city in that salary range.

I'm a lightning fast learner. I'm personable, polished, flexible and friendly though I'm a little shy. All of the developers I have been interviewing with, though they've almost exclusively been very nice, aren't very personable. At least with strangers. Again, I'm saying that as someone who considers themselves shy. I can find something in common with almost anyone and even crack a cute joke when it's appropriate. \n\nJust yesterday I went in for an interview in the financial district and was told by the hiring manager, up front, that the most they would ever consider paying me was $30,000 - because \"that's the average in New York\" when I tried to point out that wasn't true she continued to talk over me. I couldn't get a word in edgewise so I dropped it. This isn't for web design or something in the UI/UX realm - they're asking for front end *and* as much back end as possible. They want me to do client work so I imagine they're easily making 10k+ per site. They kept calling the position entry level, but they didn't seem to be impressed when some of my skills (JS/PHP) actually were entry level. Of 300+ applications, only three of us were interviewed so they must have liked my code and design skills. But they're not willing to pay me even market rate? \n\nWhen I initially started interviewing, I thought I had just run into some bad luck. It's been three months now and ~12 interviews later...it's starting to get ridiculous. It's definitely a little more than discouraging. \n\nI just don't get it. \n\nEdit: I accidentally a word.", "likes": null, "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1zn3nx", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "author": "Blooch", "media": null, "score": 22, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs0q", "edited": 1394041609.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 4, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/webdev/comments/1zn3nx/living_in_nyc_can_only_get_offers_of_25k30k/", "name": "t3_1zn3nx", "created": 1394070054.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1zn3nx/living_in_nyc_can_only_get_offers_of_25k30k/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "Living in NYC, can only get offers of 25k-30k salary for entry level development.

In the next two months I plan on building a portfilo of a few dumby sites I plan to build combining all that I've learned.\nI also plan on start looking for some open source to get involved in and freebie work for the experience.\nSo, my questions are; 1) what's the best appraoch to finding some open source projects 2) Where can I begin to look for jobs besides Careerbuilder, Monster, and Indeed 3) What feed back can you give me about my approach and what should I add to my action plan.\n\nIf you have any questions about exactly what've done and or details about my plan, please ask.", "likes": null, "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1zoqr0", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "author": "2014devgoal", "media": null, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs0q", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 1, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/webdev/comments/1zoqr0/web_developer_job_search_question/", "name": "t3_1zoqr0", "created": 1394104086.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1zoqr0/web_developer_job_search_question/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "Web developer job search question", "created_utc": 1394075286.0, "ups": 3, "num_comments": 1, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "notadesigner.com", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "webdev", "selftext_html": null, "selftext": "", "likes": null, "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1zp925", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "author": "diamondjim", "media": null, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "http://c.thumbs.redditmedia.com/UPdOC0ulfMVBteB8.jpg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs0q", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "saved": false, "is_self": false, "permalink": "/r/webdev/comments/1zp925/an_itch_i_wanted_to_scratch_a_spreadsheet_of/", "name": "t3_1zp925", "created": 1394117497.0, "url": "http://www.notadesigner.com/a-spreadsheet-of-posts-for-wordpress/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "An itch I wanted to scratch - A Spreadsheet of Posts for WordPress", "created_utc": 1394088697.0, "ups": 1, "num_comments": 0, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.webdev", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "webdev", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m part of a start up to make web designers/developers life easier and would love a look into the best and worst parts of the job.
