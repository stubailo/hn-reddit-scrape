Utilizing HTML/CSS/Wordpress etc. I&amp;#39;m not able to program, but know how to call pre-written scripts in HTML to achieve the desired result. I&amp;#39;ve been using Photoshop (which I&amp;#39;m great at) and dabble with Illustrator when vector images are needed, however I&amp;#39;m no pro with it, I just know how to get done what needs to be done. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To do these things, I use Google quite a bit for reference. I sometimes even forget the odd HTML codes and have to look them up. I&amp;#39;ve also done e-mail newsletters for companies here and there with no problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It could just be new job jitters - but I&amp;#39;m very nervous. I self-taught myself web/graphic design, so I&amp;#39;m worried that my practices might be unorthodox. Sure I know how to get the end-result I want, but I really have no idea if the way I go about is the manner taught in say college web design or graphic design courses. I&amp;#39;m definitely not a graphic design guru - although I always achieve the result I need. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also work with certain hosts. This is a pretty big company that wants websites maintained and updated, HTML/CSS e-mails constructed and sent off in e-blasts, cross-browser testing, and good knowledge of print and print formats. I&amp;#39;m used to designing these small-company websites, sending off smaller-scale newsletter type e-mails and although I know formats etc. I still have to reference Google sometimes to decide the best route to go. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m extremely nervous that my smaller scale work won&amp;#39;t be up-to-par for a bigger company that needs similar services, on a bigger scale. I start Friday and I&amp;#39;m worried that the person who I will be replacing might think I&amp;#39;m foolish if they ask me to do something I don&amp;#39;t know how to do because I approach that a different way. I&amp;#39;m a quick learner, and if I need to know something I&amp;#39;ll Google the shit out of it until I get it.........

Utilizing HTML/CSS/Wordpress etc. I'm not able to program, but know how to call pre-written scripts in HTML to achieve the desired result. I've been using Photoshop (which I'm great at) and dabble with Illustrator when vector images are needed, however I'm no pro with it, I just know how to get done what needs to be done. \n\nTo do these things, I use Google quite a bit for reference. I sometimes even forget the odd HTML codes and have to look them up. I've also done e-mail newsletters for companies here and there with no problem.\n\n\nIt could just be new job jitters - but I'm very nervous. I self-taught myself web/graphic design, so I'm worried that my practices might be unorthodox. Sure I know how to get the end-result I want, but I really have no idea if the way I go about is the manner taught in say college web design or graphic design courses. I'm definitely not a graphic design guru - although I always achieve the result I need. \n\nI also work with certain hosts. This is a pretty big company that wants websites maintained and updated, HTML/CSS e-mails constructed and sent off in e-blasts, cross-browser testing, and good knowledge of print and print formats. I'm used to designing these small-company websites, sending off smaller-scale newsletter type e-mails and although I know formats etc. I still have to reference Google sometimes to decide the best route to go. \n\nI'm extremely nervous that my smaller scale work won't be up-to-par for a bigger company that needs similar services, on a bigger scale. I start Friday and I'm worried that the person who I will be replacing might think I'm foolish if they ask me to do something I don't know how to do because I approach that a different way. I'm a quick learner, and if I need to know something I'll Google the shit out of it until I get it......... I'm just worried I'll be thrown in the deep end and I'm afraid my lack of confidence will show.\n\nI got the position through an out-sourced HR department who seemed very rushed to fill the position, and I even beat out some other candidates....... just really unsure of what to expect, and scared they may have thrown me in the deep-end in order to get the spot filled, and chose me because I just happened to be more \"charismatic\" or something along those lines.

My primary goal is to track patents that are effecting the usability of Linux but I also want it to be able to track all software patent expiry&amp;#39;s basically you should be able to add tags to a patent that you can later use to search and bring up patents that effect software you are interested in.\nThis site would be very useful for actually knowing when a patent enters the public domain (or at least getting an estimate) something that is useful for both software makers and the public as expiration dates are usually kept as quite as possible by their owners. The rise of software patent litigation is creating more and more interest in this area and their is currently no freely available website that offers this information.\nBasically I would love to have a main page that list the next say 10 patent to expire in closest to furtherest time order with a button to go to next and so on. Each patent would be have its own page with a bunch of information, patent number, estimated expiry date, basic overview, title, references etc, and the option for people to send or possible directly modify the information (wiki style) that would then be approved by a moderator. As mentioned earlier you should be able to tag things so that they can be grouped, e.g. mp3 patent pool, linux limiting patents, etc It would be great to be able to do things like list all the patents for a group and display the latest date of expiry until all the patents of that group are expired (did that make sense?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having said all this I still want the website to have a simple feel about it. Patents are a complex topic and I&amp;#39;m mainly interested in presenting one thing which is the expiry dates that effect software people are interested in. I would love to have counters like this on the patent/patent group pages &lt;a href=\"http://sagebrush.com/blog/2012/06/mp3-patent-countdown/\"&gt;http://sagebrush.com/blog/2012/06/mp3-patent-countdown/&lt;/a&gt; probably not as big but you get the idea. Basically the idea is to wikipedia style crowd effort to fill the site with the patent information which means we need a clear disclaimer this site is no run by lawyers, patent expiry&amp;#39;s may not be accurate due to the complicated nature of working out expiry dates and you should seek legal advice before using a patent that has possibly expired (possible source of advertising to pay future hosting bills?).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway the website would be voluntarily run by  myself and anyone else who wants to help. I&amp;#39;m currently looking for a web developer(s) to set-up the structure of the site and do the front end stuff to make it look pretty. Once the basics have been setup I&amp;#39;m happy to jump into the backend and help add functionality but I&amp;#39;m an application developer not a web developer so I&amp;#39;m not confident about how to get things started or making it look pretty. I&amp;#39;m happy to have a website create by *** type thing on the website if your company/you want to do it for free but want to use it for advertising. But also hoping their are web developers out their that have been following the software patent issues and are interested in doing something to help out.\nAnyway if you are interested let me know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi Guys,\n\nI want to create a website to track expiration dates of software patents. My primary goal is to track patents that are effecting the usability of Linux but I also want it to be able to track all software patent expiry's basically you should be able to add tags to a patent that you can later use to search and bring up patents that effect software you are interested in.\nThis site would be very useful for actually knowing when a patent enters the public domain (or at least getting an estimate) something that is useful for both software makers and the public as expiration dates are usually kept as quite as possible by their owners. The rise of software patent litigation is creating more and more interest in this area and their is currently no freely available website that offers this information.\nBasically I would love to have a main page that list the next say 10 patent to expire in closest to furtherest time order with a button to go to next and so on. Each patent would be have its own page with a bunch of information, patent number, estimated expiry date, basic overview, title, references etc, and the option for people to send or possible directly modify the information (wiki style) that would then be approved by a moderator.
