I have used the whole *'it's like the Internet in the 90s'* and *'it's a new technology; give it time'* to people myself before. Yet I honestly feel there area broken areas in Bitcoin that may never be resolved in order to bring it to the mainstream - if that is the aim. This isn't about buying or selling, it's just an attempt at mapping out some annoyances I've noticed through my experiences over the last few years. \n\n", "likes": null, "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1zmsbx", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "author": "marbleslab", "media": null, "score": 2156, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "edited": 1394056695.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 1348, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/1zmsbx/genuine_concerns_as_to_why_i_now_no_longer/", "name": "t3_1zmsbx", "created": 1394063451.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1zmsbx/genuine_concerns_as_to_why_i_now_no_longer/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "Genuine concerns as to why I now no longer believe in Bitcoin so much...", "created_utc": 1394034651.0, "ups": 3504, "num_comments": 1340, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Bitcoin", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So iv been reading posts/comments on here lately and it seems like there is some serious misunderstandings by alot of people in regards for the time it takes for a transaction to get confirmed on the blockchain, especially in the use case of merchant PoS sales.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You guys are comparing apples to oranges here&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The time it takes for one confirmation is how long it takes for a transaction to be CLEARED.
