I have almost nine years in Photoshop/ACS. I know all about CMS including Wordpress, Joomla and Expression Engine. I can write basic vanilla JavaScript and PHP from scratch and I&amp;#39;m excellent at debugging/modifying it. I work with MySQL databases on a daily basis and can write queries all day long. With more complex PHP/JS scripts I can usually figure out what I&amp;#39;m doing with a little Googling. I get version control, FTP, Bootstrap and a couple frameworks. I&amp;#39;ve worked in major eCommerce platforms like Magento and Shopify. I&amp;#39;m excellent in SEO and have proof of my results. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have much office experience but I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what I&amp;#39;m doing - which is why I keep applying for entry level jobs. The most I&amp;#39;ve been offered so far is 32k with a dozen asterisks attached (Contract basis, starting part time, ineligible for a raise for the first year.) but like I said, I just can&amp;#39;t afford to go into the city on a daily basis for that. I&amp;#39;m a lightning fast learner. I&amp;#39;m personable, polished, flexible and friendly though I&amp;#39;m a little shy. All of the developers I have been interviewing with, though they&amp;#39;ve almost exclusively been very nice, aren&amp;#39;t very personable. At least with strangers. Again, I&amp;#39;m saying that as someone who considers themselves shy. I can find something in common with almost anyone and even crack a cute joke when it&amp;#39;s appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday I went in for an interview in the financial district and was told by the hiring manager, up front, that the most they would ever consider paying me was $30,000 - because &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s the average in New York&amp;quot; when I tried to point out that wasn&amp;#39;t true she continued to talk over me. I couldn&amp;#39;t get a word in edgewise so I dropped it. This isn&amp;#39;t for web design or something in the UI/UX realm - they&amp;#39;re asking for front end &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; as much back end as possible. They want me to do client work so I imagine they&amp;#39;re easily making 10k+ per site. They kept calling the position entry level, but they didn&amp;#39;t seem to be impressed when some of my skills (JS/PHP) actually were entry level. Of 300+ applications, only three of us were interviewed so they must have liked my code and design skills. But they&amp;#39;re not willing to pay me even market rate? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I initially started interviewing, I thought I had just run into some bad luck. It&amp;#39;s been three months now and ~12 interviews later...it&amp;#39;s starting to get ridiculous. It&amp;#39;s definitely a little more than discouraging. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t get it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I accidentally a word.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Basically, I can't afford to park my fucking car while I go into the city in that salary range. I've been repeatedly told 60k is typical for an entry level developer in Manhattan by people who work here. The Reported national average is slightly below that, and city averages are even higher: \n\nhttp://www.indeed.com/salary/q-Entry-Level-Web-Developer-l-New-York,-NY.html \n\nhttps://www.computerworld.com/spring/salary-survey/2013/job_level/3\n\nhttp://www.simplyhired.com/salaries-k-entry-level-web-developer-jobs.html\n\nSo here's my sob story:\n\nI've been working in freelance development for going on seven years now, though I only claim 3-4 years on my resume because that's when I started seriously investing my time into it. \n\nI'm fluent in HTML(5)/CSS(3) with responsive design employing mostly UI/UX best practices. I have almost nine years in Photoshop/ACS. I know all about CMS including Wordpress, Joomla and Expression Engine. I can write basic vanilla JavaScript and PHP from scratch and I'm excellent at debugging/modifying it. I work with MySQL databases on a daily basis and can write queries all day long. With more complex PHP/JS scripts I can usually figure out what I'm doing with a little Googling. I get version control, FTP, Bootstrap and a couple frameworks. I've worked in major eCommerce platforms like Magento and Shopify. I'm excellent in SEO and have proof of my results. \n\nI don't have much office experience but I *know* what I'm doing - which is why I keep applying for entry level jobs. The most I've been offered so far is 32k with a dozen asterisks attached (Contract basis, starting part time, ineligible for a raise for the first year.) but like I said, I just can't afford to go into the city on a daily basis for that. I'm a lightning fast learner. I'm personable, polished, flexible and friendly though I'm a little shy. All of the developers I have been interviewing with, though they've almost exclusively been very nice, aren't very personable. At least with strangers. Again, I'm saying that as someone who considers themselves shy. I can find something in common with almost anyone and even crack a cute joke when it's appropriate. \n\nJust yesterday I went in for an interview in the financial district and was told by the hiring manager, up front, that the most they would ever consider paying me was $30,000 - because \"that's the average in New York\" when I tried to point out that wasn't true she continued to talk over me.
