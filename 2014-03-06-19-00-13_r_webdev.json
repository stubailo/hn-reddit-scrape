I'm definitely not a graphic design guru - although I always achieve the result I need. \n\nI also work with certain hosts. This is a pretty big company that wants websites maintained and updated, HTML/CSS e-mails constructed and sent off in e-blasts, cross-browser testing, and good knowledge of print and print formats. I'm used to designing these small-company websites, sending off smaller-scale newsletter type e-mails and although I know formats etc. I still have to reference Google sometimes to decide the best route to go. \n\nI'm extremely nervous that my smaller scale work won't be up-to-par for a bigger company that needs similar services, on a bigger scale. I start Friday and I'm worried that the person who I will be replacing might think I'm foolish if they ask me to do something I don't know how to do because I approach that a different way. I'm a quick learner, and if I need to know something I'll Google the shit out of it until I get it......... I'm just worried I'll be thrown in the deep end and I'm afraid my lack of confidence will show.\n\nI got the position through an out-sourced HR department who seemed very rushed to fill the position, and I even beat out some other candidates....... just really unsure of what to expect, and scared they may have thrown me in the deep-end in order to get the spot filled, and chose me because I just happened to be more \"charismatic\" or something along those lines. Any advice?
