If you found value in it; please upvote and get involved in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am Eric Bandholz, founder of &lt;a href=\"http://www.beardbrand.com\"&gt;Beardbrand&lt;/a&gt;, and we build and sell beard care products; as well as other items for the bearded lifestyle. Our tagline is that &amp;quot;We foster style for the urban beardsman.&amp;quot; Many startup companies focus on selling their products, but they neglect building their brand. While simply selling is difficult, it&amp;#39;s still easier than creating a brand. This guide shows how we are building a brand with Beardbrand and what you should focus on. Keep in mind that not all businesses need to build a brand, but if you are B2C company it should be a pretty high priority.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages of building a brand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Customers will be more loyal&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Your products can carry a higher price point&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Word of mouth marketing / viral marketing is more common&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Valuation of your company will be higher (One example: the US company Electrolux sold their brand and nothing else to the Sweedish Electrolux. Their new brand is now known as &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerus_LLC\"&gt;Aerus&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages of building a brand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s more expensive&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s a longer strategy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Must invest in more company culture to ensure brand is not tarnished&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Return on investment is not as clear as call to action marketing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A tarnished brand loses all the hardwork you&amp;#39;ve done to build it up&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Start&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First you will want to commit to building a brand, and all the challenges that presents. You will have to be prepared to say &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; and stick to your guns. Inconsistency is the death to brands. Spend a lot of time up front to truly understand what you want to be and how you want to present your company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With Beardbrand we developed the term &amp;quot;urban beardsman&amp;quot; which describes a man with a beard who cares about their style, their grooming habits, and who has a plan and a vision with their personal life. Traditionally beardsmen were thought of as hippies, bikers, outdoorsmen, or homeless folks. We wanted to unite people who didn&amp;#39;t feel like they fit those labels. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To get this rolling we place an emphasis on design and branding. Our logo is simple and clean. Our primary colors are black and white and secondary color is cyan. We have had our tagline front and center on our store since we created it. Fortunately, I am a self taught designer and have implemented a lot of our designs. If you do not have those skills, you will need to invest in a quality designer. Most likely you won&amp;#39;t find those at Fiverr, 99 designs, or any of those spec work places. Try instead to search for them via Dribbble, &lt;a href=\"/r/graphic_design\"&gt;/r/graphic_design&lt;/a&gt;, your local AIGA club, or other places designers like to hang out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plan on establishing a relationship with a designer you can trust and work with. You&amp;#39;ll want to send all (or at least a majority of) your designs to them so that you create brand consistency. All designers have different styles, and like I said before; inconsistency a roadblock to building a quality brand. A good designer can also help you with brand guidelines to keep you and others on track. It&amp;#39;s essentially a blueprint on how to keep things consistent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Build&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First off, it&amp;#39;s important that you walk the walk.

Based on our target audience, we decided to provide a premium experience to our customers. To us that means quality products, fast shipping, no hassle customer service, and no sales pressure. How this reflects on our business is that we are using premium oils that put beard care first, quality packaging, shipping within one business day, making things right with customers when things go wrong, and offer no discounts or sales on our store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we attend events, trade shows, or put on parties - then we carry the same attitude and image that we portray online.

I stand by our viewpoint that our product is fantastic, and when people are ready to buy they will buy.

We use Nordstrom&amp;#39;s and Lululemon as inspiration.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We don&amp;#39;t put advertisements on our YouTube videos.

In a land of 10 day old internet memes, we could exponentially grow our user base by simply posting beard meme&amp;#39;s. While, it may slow us down in growth; it&amp;#39;s more important for us to accurately show we are about. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We market with no direct performance tracking.

Most important thing; be consistent and be the company that you present yourself as.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "First off, I think this is the type of content /r/entrepreneur needs. If you found value in it; please upvote and get involved in the comments.\n\n**Intro**\n\nI am Eric Bandholz, founder of [Beardbrand](http://www.beardbrand.com), and we build and sell beard care products; as well as other items for the bearded lifestyle. Our tagline is that \"We foster style for the urban beardsman.\" Many startup companies focus on selling their products, but they neglect building their brand. While simply selling is difficult, it's still easier than creating a brand. This guide shows how we are building a brand with Beardbrand and what you should focus on. Keep in mind that not all businesses need to build a brand, but if you are B2C company it should be a pretty high priority.\n\n**Advantages of building a brand**\n\n* Customers will be more loyal\n* Your products can carry a higher price point\n* Word of mouth marketing / viral marketing is more common\n* Valuation of your company will be higher (One example: the US company Electrolux sold their brand and nothing else to the Sweedish Electrolux. Their new brand is now known as [Aerus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerus_LLC).)\n\n**Disadvantages of building a brand**\n\n* It's more expensive\n* It's a longer strategy\n* Must invest in more company culture to ensure brand is not tarnished\n* Return on investment is not as clear as call to action marketing\n* A tarnished brand loses all the hardwork you've done to build it up\n\n**The Start**\n\nFirst you will want to commit to building a brand, and all the challenges that presents. You will have to be prepared to say \"no\" and stick to your guns. Inconsistency is the death to brands. Spend a lot of time up front to truly understand what you want to be and how you want to present your company.\n\nWith Beardbrand we developed the term \"urban beardsman\" which describes a man with a beard who cares about their style, their grooming habits, and who has a plan and a vision with their personal life. Traditionally beardsmen were thought of as hippies, bikers, outdoorsmen, or homeless folks. We wanted to unite people who didn't feel like they fit those labels. \n\nTo get this rolling we place an emphasis on design and branding. Our logo is simple and clean. Our primary colors are black and white and secondary color is cyan. We have had our tagline front and center on our store since we created it. Fortunately, I am a self taught designer and have implemented a lot of our designs. If you do not have those skills, you will need to invest in a quality designer. Most likely you won't find those at Fiverr, 99 designs, or any of those spec work places. Try instead to search for them via Dribbble, /r/graphic_design, your local AIGA club, or other places designers like to hang out.\n\nPlan on establishing a relationship with a designer you can trust and work with. You'll want to send all (or at least a majority of) your designs to them so that you create brand consistency. All designers have different styles, and like I said before; inconsistency a roadblock to building a quality brand. A good designer can also help you with brand guidelines to keep you and others on track. It's essentially a blueprint on how to keep things consistent.\n\n**The Build**\n\nFirst off, it's important that you walk the walk. IE; the image you are trying to create of your brand is something you actually eat, drink, sleep and live. You'll want to tie together your branding across all your channels. That means your actions, business cards, website, merchandise, advertisements, emails, marketing, etc must all be cohesive. To show you how we did it, here are a few elements Beardbrand has created.\n\n* [Website](http://www.beardbrand.com)\n* [Our Vision Page](http://www.beardbrand.com/pages/beardbrand-vision) *very important for us\n* [Video of our vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eKg9GdDpQY)\n* [One of our ads](http://i.imgur.com/LbQstD4.jpg)\n* [Business Cards](http://dribbble.com/shots/1103944-Beardbrand-business-cards?list=show)\n* [PR Kit](http://instagram.com/p/kiUhjVMYAq/)\n* [Mustache Wax Packaging](http://i.imgur.com/9NTzzUe.jpg)\n* [Beard Oil Packaging](http://i.imgur.com/3dLIedD.jpg)\n\nIn addition to your brand's design and feel, your company also has a brand on how it performs. Based on our target audience, we decided to provide a premium experience to our customers. To us that means quality products, fast shipping, no hassle customer service, and no sales pressure.

It was a 60 second video and all I did was optimize it for the search engine (I\u2019ll tell you exactly what I did on this webinar).\n\u00a0\nThis Livestream training will reveal the 3 lead-generation videos that every business must have including:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Story Of You- building the Like, Know and Trust Factor through self-promotion\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Customer Success Story- influencing new clients to seek the results you provide\nand a Juicy\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SEO Lead Generator- including mine that brought RIDICULOUS sales overnight\n\u00a0\nSign Up Here: http://lightscamerascashin.com/webinar-signup/\n\nBackground on me: Hi my name is Zephan Blaxberg and I own ZMBmedia, a Baltimore based video production company. My background is in marketing for some of the top marketers in the world including Bill Glazer, Dan Kennedy, Mara Glazer and others. I put together a webinar that will walk you through exactly what you need to know to start bringing in more clients and customers by using video. I started my business in May of last year after leaving my full time job at Apple and I've grown to 5 figures a month faster than I could have imagined. No this isn't one of those spammy get rich quick strategies and yes it does take effort but it's about what works in marketing today. So many people grow up thinking they'll start a business and \"if you build it, he will come.\" The truth of the matter is no customer will ever find you unless you use the most effective forms of marketing. Video, being one of them.
