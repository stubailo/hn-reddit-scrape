That his genius and his life, the latter now against his will revealed by a reporter \u2013 it's her job, understandably \u2013 is a true inspiration to me.\n\nDespite his apparent effort to live a normal life with his family, what is to come will not simply be a storm of media coverage. He will have to shut the blinds, stay home, and fear now that his fortune (and presumable access to it) is revealed, different parties will go after him for motives you could imagine. Media, the government, companies, and maybe people who want him to bail out MtGox, if not pay off the money they lost on gambling sites.\n\nWe should respect him as a person \u2013 an extraordinary person that created a system that opened many's eyes to not only the a monetary tool that frees us from any central institution, for better or for worse, but also to the idea that has been so empowering and given rise to a host of innovations in the world. He has brought hope and possibility to the community that shares the same believes, and numerous constructive discussions on subjects that extend beyond the Internet.\n\nThank you, Satoshi.", "likes": null, "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1zprtk", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "author": "ThankYouSatoshi", "media": null, "score": 535, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "edited": 1394112693.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 293, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/1zprtk/thank_you_satoshi_nakamoto/", "name": "t3_1zprtk", "created": 1394139773.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1zprtk/thank_you_satoshi_nakamoto/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "Thank you, Satoshi Nakamoto", "created_utc": 1394110973.0, "ups": 828, "num_comments": 237, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Bitcoin", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;proof&amp;quot; is the guy has the same name and vaguely relevant credentials.
