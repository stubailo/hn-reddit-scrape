I keep coming across all these backends and libraries like Bootstrap, PureCSS, jQuery, CakePHP, etc. How do all of those come into play these days?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How are websites made by outside developers hosted these days?

Or is something else more common?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I were to offer web design for free to build up a portfolio, how should I go about doing that? Who would pay for the domain/hosting costs?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is more specific: A family friend approached me a few months ago to setup a cheap website. I got the content and setup a Wordpress.com website in their name, and added the content. (It was cheaper than Hostgator or Godaddy at least.)

Would it make more sense to try to work with others and specialize in some particular aspect web development? Should I try to get hired somewhere?
