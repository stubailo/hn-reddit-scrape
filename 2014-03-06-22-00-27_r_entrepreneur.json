What&amp;#39;s your product or service ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will be launching a worldwide online directory within a couple months or so. I&amp;#39;m visioning a free listing database with map shown for new start-ups, entrepreneurs and small business owners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can promote your works, business, passion, project, website --backlink allowed from a .org domain-- (like craiglist, linkedin) and share your success story at a more personal level (facebook); while presenting it professionally (yellowpages) to reach out for a larger audience both local and online. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. What motivated you to start a business ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a reason behind this website all along. When I first ventured into self business (blogging for passive income in particular), I always wanted a place or someone to kickstart and support my ideas. Most people think giving up a decent paid 9-5 is stupid and even friends or family could be quite negative about it. Then when it came to promotion I found Facebook was a good place but its demographic users are not really fit for the serious niche I was in. After that linkedin is another good, big place but it falls short because people closed up and they only care to present their best image instead of really open up, connect and grow. It was also very difficult to compete with more popular sites on search engines. I wish I had a partner or two to help me cross promo even just via a tweet (but I don&amp;#39;t know anyone on Twitter). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now all the dust settled for me and years of struggling paid off, I still want to build a website like that. Something could help me as a consumers find better business and talents (not only services from big corporate and chain stores), or help self-made success people find more friends in the same fields to grow their business with the strength of many. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. How long have you been working on your startup ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two months. But it&amp;#39;s a project that has been incubated for 7 years haha. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. What is your 6month plan? 5year plan ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within the first 6-month after launch, I want to do interviews on people (entrepreneurs) who made it to millionaires/billionaire status and find out how they did it. Then share on the website to inspire people. I&amp;#39;ll also give out free Premium Listing (more on this later) to help new start-ups get their voice across our network. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the 5-year plan, I&amp;#39;m shooting for $500,000/mo. Since craiglist does $60M a year which is ~$5M/mo, I&amp;#39;m hoping for 1/10th of that in 5 years. The main income will be from Adsense, Private Ad and Premium Listing. Now Premium Listing is just a slight upgrade from Free Listing which gives business owners more opportunity to increase brand awareness on the website and it costs 50 cents per month ($6/yr).

What's your product or service ?**\n\nI will be launching a worldwide online directory within a couple months or so. I'm visioning a free listing database with map shown for new start-ups, entrepreneurs and small business owners.\n\nYou can promote your works, business, passion, project, website --backlink allowed from a .org domain-- (like craiglist, linkedin) and share your success story at a more personal level (facebook); while presenting it professionally (yellowpages) to reach out for a larger audience both local and online. \n\n\n**2. What motivated you to start a business ?**\n\nThere is a reason behind this website all along. When I first ventured into self business (blogging for passive income in particular), I always wanted a place or someone to kickstart and support my ideas. Most people think giving up a decent paid 9-5 is stupid and even friends or family could be quite negative about it. Then when it came to promotion I found Facebook was a good place but its demographic users are not really fit for the serious niche I was in. After that linkedin is another good, big place but it falls short because people closed up and they only care to present their best image instead of really open up, connect and grow. It was also very difficult to compete with more popular sites on search engines. I wish I had a partner or two to help me cross promo even just via a tweet (but I don't know anyone on Twitter). \n\nNow all the dust settled for me and years of struggling paid off, I still want to build a website like that. Something could help me as a consumers find better business and talents (not only services from big corporate and chain stores), or help self-made success people find more friends in the same fields to grow their business with the strength of many. \n\n\n**3. How long have you been working on your startup ?**\n\nTwo months. But it's a project that has been incubated for 7 years haha. \n\n\n**4. What is your 6month plan? 5year plan ?**\n\nWithin the first 6-month after launch, I want to do interviews on people (entrepreneurs) who made it to millionaires/billionaire status and find out how they did it. Then share on the website to inspire people. I'll also give out free Premium Listing (more on this later) to help new start-ups get their voice across our network. \n\nIn the 5-year plan, I'm shooting for $500,000/mo. Since craiglist does $60M a year which is ~$5M/mo, I'm hoping for 1/10th of that in 5 years. The main income will be from Adsense, Private Ad and Premium Listing. Now Premium Listing is just a slight upgrade from Free Listing which gives business owners more opportunity to increase brand awareness on the website and it costs 50 cents per month ($6/yr). All listing expires in 1 year instead of 30 days like craiglist and free to renew.\n\n\n**5.If you could travel back in time, what advice would you give yourself ?**\n\nI'd tell myself to ask for advice here. So..what advice would you have for me ? What should I avoid doing ? If you are a new start-up, what would you expect from me that could help push your business forward ? \n\n\n\n* I'd like to show my token of appreciation by giving you a premium account for your business or profile on this website for your feedback (optional).

Reason being is that we found a fantastic location and a created a unique menu.\n\nI know about establishing out business legally in California, but I'm looking for a few tips in what I'll be needing to run a small restaurant In this state:\n\nWhat type of licensing do we need to serve food and to serve alcohol? \n\nAre there permits or inspections that need to be done before we open? How long can this delay things or how soon in advance should I apply?\n\nCan you recommend a good POS platform that will print order tickets in the back?
