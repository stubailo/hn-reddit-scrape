We have a new outlet in a retail store and are looking to build an e-commerce website.\n\nOur products are low cost, with decent margins.  I'd like to get the website going with about 20 product lines for as little cost as possible.  Any suggestions for cheap templates/hosts out there?  squarespace? godaddy?  This is all new to me, so any help would be appreciated.\n\nThank you!", "likes": null, "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1zjgml", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "author": "WalleyeGuy", "media": null, "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1zjgml/ecommerce_website_templatehost_suggestions/", "name": "t3_1zjgml", "created": 1393979893.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1zjgml/ecommerce_website_templatehost_suggestions/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "E-Commerce website template/host suggestions", "created_utc": 1393951093.0, "ups": 10, "num_comments": 15, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Entrepreneur", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi there a friend of mine told me about this sub and recommended that I post our story here.
