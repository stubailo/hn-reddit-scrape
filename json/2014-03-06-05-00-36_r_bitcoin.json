Normally in London, sometimes Berlin. &lt;strong&gt;The transactions can take a couple of minutes (no exaggeration) to verify.&lt;/strong&gt; It can be pretty awkward at times. Compare this with the new NFC credit card technology we have (in the UK at least) where you just tap your card against the reader and the payment processes &lt;em&gt;instantly&lt;/em&gt;, no QR codes, no confirmation waiting time, no passwords or numbers - I don&amp;#39;t even need a mobile phone. Credit card fees aside, why would a supermarket ever adopt Bitcoin over this? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Digital security is WAY behind digital currency&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This part scares the hell out of me. Some people are walking around with files that are worth as much as a house. Sure you can back up, back up a back up, use 2FA, change your email passwords every day, use an on screen keyboard, buy a brand new computer that has never been connected to the Internet to make paperwallets to store in a fireproof box, store your encrypted USB back ups in a safety deposit box... but it still scares me. I still have nightmares about being knocked over one day, taking a blow to the head and forgetting passwords. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never before have we had to protect such valuable files&lt;/strong&gt; and every day we see posts here on &lt;a href=\"/r/bitcoin\"&gt;/r/bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; of people losing fortunes. I know there&amp;#39;s the whole QE thing, the banking bail outs and all the other shit that comes with fiat currency, but at least if my credit card gets stolen, I&amp;#39;m insured and protected. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The recent MtGox implosion -- and the subsequent &lt;em&gt;reaction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MtGox has lost nearly $500,000,000. Yet all I see is: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Why would you have money on an exchange anyway?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s good that MtGox has gone&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Hahaha, all the stupid greedy people have lost their money&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s the free market DUH! Bitcoin will survive&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of these statements, however true, are quite disgusting. People had a lot of money in MtGox for various reasons; I saw very very few indications or posts that suggested bankruptcy (it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; the world&amp;#39;s most popular exchange). It doesn&amp;#39;t make them foolish, greedy, or deserving to lose their collective $500m. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The alternatives right now are unregulated, Slovenian and Russian websites. &lt;strong&gt;Go back a few weeks and I would&amp;#39;ve placed money on BTC-E stealing everyone&amp;#39;s funds before MtGox.&lt;/strong&gt; Assuming BTC-E does disappear for some reason over the next 12 months and we&amp;#39;ll no doubt see a bunch of posts from people along the lines of: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Idiot! Why would you wire money to an unregulated Russian website?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;You knew the risks, it&amp;#39;s your fault&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;You should&amp;#39;ve learned not to trade BTC after MtGox... greedy&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure Bitcoin will survive. Set backs are set backs though. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Consumer protection&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one won&amp;#39;t be too popular with you lot but here goes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trezor - they look my 1BTC/$600 about 6 months ago on the basis that they would provide me my Trezor within 3 months. It&amp;#39;s been about 6 months now. There&amp;#39;s no estimated shipping date, just a lot of delays. If I had paid with Paypal or CC, it&amp;#39;s likely that I&amp;#39;d have my money back by now -- could&amp;#39;ve at least have made a complaint. Trezor won&amp;#39;t give me a refund and there&amp;#39;s not much to stop them from running off with everyone&amp;#39;s money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Butterfly Labs - See above. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also bought some random Bitcoin keyring off a site that no longer exists. Paid my money, nothing came, gone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of this has left me extremely cautious when purchasing &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; over the Internet with Bitcoin. You may be ok with a large established site like Overstock, but &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;d never buy anything from a Bitcoin start-up as I have no protection&lt;/strong&gt; in comparison to Paypal or Credit Cards. Bitcoin really does suck for these kinds of transactions, you hand all power over to the vendor and relinquish all consumer rights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;ve been &amp;#39;in&amp;#39; Bitcoin since 2011. I have used the whole &lt;em&gt;&amp;#39;it&amp;#39;s like the Internet in the 90s&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&amp;#39;it&amp;#39;s a new technology; give it time&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt; to people myself before. Yet I honestly feel there area broken areas in Bitcoin that may never be resolved in order to bring it to the mainstream - if that is the aim. This isn&amp;#39;t about buying or selling, it&amp;#39;s just an attempt at mapping out some annoyances I&amp;#39;ve noticed through my experiences over the last few years. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I'll obviously get down voted to hell here, but I feel it's right to voice my genuine concerns.

Normally in London, sometimes Berlin. **The transactions can take a couple of minutes (no exaggeration) to verify.** It can be pretty awkward at times. Compare this with the new NFC credit card technology we have (in the UK at least) where you just tap your card against the reader and the payment processes *instantly*, no QR codes, no confirmation waiting time, no passwords or numbers - I don't even need a mobile phone. Credit card fees aside, why would a supermarket ever adopt Bitcoin over this? \n\n2. Digital security is WAY behind digital currency\n\nThis part scares the hell out of me. Some people are walking around with files that are worth as much as a house. Sure you can back up, back up a back up, use 2FA, change your email passwords every day, use an on screen keyboard, buy a brand new computer that has never been connected to the Internet to make paperwallets to store in a fireproof box, store your encrypted USB back ups in a safety deposit box... but it still scares me. I still have nightmares about being knocked over one day, taking a blow to the head and forgetting passwords. \n\n**Never before have we had to protect such valuable files** and every day we see posts here on /r/bitcoin of people losing fortunes. I know there's the whole QE thing, the banking bail outs and all the other shit that comes with fiat currency, but at least if my credit card gets stolen, I'm insured and protected. \n\n\n3. The recent MtGox implosion -- and the subsequent *reaction*\n\nMtGox has lost nearly $500,000,000. Yet all I see is: \n\n*\"Why would you have money on an exchange anyway?\"*\n\n*\"It's good that MtGox has gone\"*\n\n*\"Hahaha, all the stupid greedy people have lost their money\"*\n\n*\"It's the free market DUH! Bitcoin will survive\"* \n\nAll of these statements, however true, are quite disgusting. People had a lot of money in MtGox for various reasons; I saw very very few indications or posts that suggested bankruptcy (it *was* the world's most popular exchange). It doesn't make them foolish, greedy, or deserving to lose their collective $500m. \n\nThe alternatives right now are unregulated, Slovenian and Russian websites. **Go back a few weeks and I would've placed money on BTC-E stealing everyone's funds before MtGox.** Assuming BTC-E does disappear for some reason over the next 12 months and we'll no doubt see a bunch of posts from people along the lines of: \n\n*\"Idiot! Why would you wire money to an unregulated Russian website?\"*\n\n*\"You knew the risks, it's your fault\"* \n\n*\"You should've learned not to trade BTC after MtGox... greedy\"* \n\nSure Bitcoin will survive. Set backs are set backs though. \n\n4. Consumer protection\n\nThis one won't be too popular with you lot but here goes:\n \nTrezor - they look my 1BTC/$600 about 6 months ago on the basis that they would provide me my Trezor within 3 months. It's been about 6 months now. There's no estimated shipping date, just a lot of delays. If I had paid with Paypal or CC, it's likely that I'd have my money back by now -- could've at least have made a complaint. Trezor won't give me a refund and there's not much to stop them from running off with everyone's money. \n\nButterfly Labs - See above. \n\nI also bought some random Bitcoin keyring off a site that no longer exists. Paid my money, nothing came, gone. \n\nAll of this has left me extremely cautious when purchasing *anything* over the Internet with Bitcoin. You may be ok with a large established site like Overstock, but **I'd never buy anything from a Bitcoin start-up as I have no protection** in comparison to Paypal or Credit Cards. Bitcoin really does suck for these kinds of transactions, you hand all power over to the vendor and relinquish all consumer rights.\n\n\n\n**EDIT:** I've been 'in' Bitcoin since 2011. I have used the whole *'it's like the Internet in the 90s'* and *'it's a new technology; give it time'* to people myself before. Yet I honestly feel there area broken areas in Bitcoin that may never be resolved in order to bring it to the mainstream - if that is the aim. This isn't about buying or selling, it's just an attempt at mapping out some annoyances I've noticed through my experiences over the last few years. \n\n", "likes": null, "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1zmsbx", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "author": "marbleslab", "media": null, "score": 2014, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "edited": 1394056695.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 1099, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/1zmsbx/genuine_concerns_as_to_why_i_now_no_longer/", "name": "t3_1zmsbx", "created": 1394063451.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1zmsbx/genuine_concerns_as_to_why_i_now_no_longer/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "Genuine concerns as to why I now no longer believe in Bitcoin so much...", "created_utc": 1394034651.0, "ups": 3113, "num_comments": 1165, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "youtube.com", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe class=\"embedly-embed\" src=\"//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Freo7WbibxaQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dreo7WbibxaQ&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Freo7WbibxaQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=2aa3c4d5f3de4f5b9120b660ad850dc9&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "width": 600, "scrolling": false, "height": 338}, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "selftext_html": null, "selftext": "", "likes": null, "secure_media": {"type": "youtube.com", "oembed": {"provider_url": "http://www.youtube.com/", "description": "Like this video?

--&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, as the title implies... I was one of the suckers who bought into the whole ButterFly labs gimmick a year ago. I ordered the 10Gh/sec miner and had to wait nearly 9 months to get it. It finally came back in January this year and I don&amp;#39;t even think it&amp;#39;s worth running to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But regardless, I kept it running most of the time because it wasn&amp;#39;t using too much power. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was just sitting at my computer playing a game, the miner sits on my desk next to my monitor. All of a sudden the miner shuts off, fans and all, and was silent. A few seconds later it starts sparking on the inside and I saw flames through the air vents. So I quickly unplugged it and run with it into my kitchen to place it on the granite counter-top.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t supposed to be a sob story or anything, but as a young guy I just wanted to know what my options are for this situation.

I was one of the suckers who bought into the whole ButterFly labs gimmick a year ago. I ordered the 10Gh/sec miner and had to wait nearly 9 months to get it. It finally came back in January this year and I don't even think it's worth running to be honest.\n\nBut regardless, I kept it running most of the time because it wasn't using too much power. \n\nI was just sitting at my computer playing a game, the miner sits on my desk next to my monitor. All of a sudden the miner shuts off, fans and all, and was silent. A few seconds later it starts sparking on the inside and I saw flames through the air vents. So I quickly unplugged it and run with it into my kitchen to place it on the granite counter-top.\n\nThis isn't supposed to be a sob story or anything, but as a young guy I just wanted to know what my options are for this situation.
