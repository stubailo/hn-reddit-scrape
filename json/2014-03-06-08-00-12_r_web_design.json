I see many nice elements of sites I'd like to put my own spin on but what looks like it shouldn't be too hard to make is a lot harder in practice to create. I've read that fireworks is good for web graphics and easier to master but as it's being phased out and not industry standard maybe it wouldn't be a good idea to start learning that.\n\nDoes anyone know any tutorials/articles that shows a more modern approach to making mockups and designing UI elements in Photoshop? All I have found so far are just singular tutorials and would prefer to get my teeth into a more comprehensive and structured course if such a thing is available.\n\nThanks,", "likes": null, "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1zmu0y", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "author": "mug2k", "media": null, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1m", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 1, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/web_design/comments/1zmu0y/designing_is_photoshop_the_best_and_most_useful/", "name": "t3_1zmu0y", "created": 1394064484.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/1zmu0y/designing_is_photoshop_the_best_and_most_useful/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "Designing - Is Photoshop the best and most useful to learn?", "created_utc": 1394035684.0, "ups": 14, "num_comments": 34, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.web_design", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "web_design", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing is more annoying than when I&amp;#39;m making tweaks to a css or HTML file and I am uploading it a bunch of times over and over, and a change doesn&amp;#39;t go into effect because I have to clear the cache - and sometimes I even have to restart the browser.
