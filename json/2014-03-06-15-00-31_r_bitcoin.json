Why would you wire money to an unregulated Russian website?\"*\n\n*\"You knew the risks, it's your fault\"* \n\n*\"You should've learned not to trade BTC after MtGox... greedy\"* \n\nSure Bitcoin will survive. Set backs are set backs though. \n\n4. Consumer protection\n\nThis one won't be too popular with you lot but here goes:\n \nTrezor - they look my 1BTC/$600 about 6 months ago on the basis that they would provide me my Trezor within 3 months. It's been about 6 months now. There's no estimated shipping date, just a lot of delays. If I had paid with Paypal or CC, it's likely that I'd have my money back by now -- could've at least have made a complaint. Trezor won't give me a refund and there's not much to stop them from running off with everyone's money. \n\nButterfly Labs - See above. \n\nI also bought some random Bitcoin keyring off a site that no longer exists. Paid my money, nothing came, gone. \n\nAll of this has left me extremely cautious when purchasing *anything* over the Internet with Bitcoin. You may be ok with a large established site like Overstock, but **I'd never buy anything from a Bitcoin start-up as I have no protection** in comparison to Paypal or Credit Cards. Bitcoin really does suck for these kinds of transactions, you hand all power over to the vendor and relinquish all consumer rights.\n\n\n\n**EDIT:** I've been 'in' Bitcoin since 2011. I have used the whole *'it's like the Internet in the 90s'* and *'it's a new technology; give it time'* to people myself before. Yet I honestly feel there area broken areas in Bitcoin that may never be resolved in order to bring it to the mainstream - if that is the aim. This isn't about buying or selling, it's just an attempt at mapping out some annoyances I've noticed through my experiences over the last few years. \n\n", "likes": null, "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1zmsbx", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "author": "marbleslab", "media": null, "score": 2151, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "edited": 1394056695.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 1315, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/1zmsbx/genuine_concerns_as_to_why_i_now_no_longer/", "name": "t3_1zmsbx", "created": 1394063451.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1zmsbx/genuine_concerns_as_to_why_i_now_no_longer/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "Genuine concerns as to why I now no longer believe in Bitcoin so much...", "created_utc": 1394034651.0, "distinguished": null, "num_comments": 1317, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "ups": 3466}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Bitcoin", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So iv been reading posts/comments on here lately and it seems like there is some serious misunderstandings by alot of people in regards for the time it takes for a transaction to get confirmed on the blockchain, especially in the use case of merchant PoS sales.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You guys are comparing apples to oranges here&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The time it takes for one confirmation is how long it takes for a transaction to be CLEARED.
