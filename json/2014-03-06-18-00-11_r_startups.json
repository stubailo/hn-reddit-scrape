I'm looking into starting a more traditional business, a real estate brokerage based in downtown Detroit.\n\nCan you answer these 3 questions for me - so that I can do some preliminary research for my investors.\n\n1. In your opinion, what is the best real estate brokerage/firm in your city for sales? How about for rentals?\n\n2. What makes them better than the rest?\n\n3. Which city is this?\n\nThanks r/startups!", "likes": null, "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1zp2qf", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "author": "metadetroit", "media": null, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh26", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 4, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/startups/comments/1zp2qf/help_me_do_a_case_study_would_you_can_you_answer/", "name": "t3_1zp2qf", "created": 1394112170.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1zp2qf/help_me_do_a_case_study_would_you_can_you_answer/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "Help me do a Case Study, would you?
