I've tried changing the object name to Label1 and that doesn't work. \n\nI have put in the code that the lesson instructed:\nLabel1.Text=\"This is the page for my Homework1. Today is\" + DateAndTime.DateString(); ---but that wouldn't work either.\n\nI've tried different time date suggestions from MSDN, and I always get a similar error. It just won't display in a browser. \n\nIf anyone knows how to get the script to display in a browser, I would be very grateful. \n\nThanks\n\n", "likes": null, "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1zrkp4", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "author": "riteturnclyde", "media": null, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs0q", "edited": 1394152205.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/webdev/comments/1zrkp4/helpaspxcs_script_file_not_working/", "name": "t3_1zrkp4", "created": 1394179450.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1zrkp4/helpaspxcs_script_file_not_working/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "help--aspx.cs script file not working", "created_utc": 1394150650.0, "ups": 1, "num_comments": 2, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.webdev", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "webdev", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically looking for web developers that can do simple stuff quickly (email templates, landing pages) as well as more complicated stuff (PHP, HTML5 for Mobile, Mobile apps) with longer (but still relatively compact) timelines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;#39;m in the ATL and prefer hiring local resources when possible.
