I\u2019m currently working on a product called Betty (http://trybetty.com) that allows users to schedule completely within email without the back and forth.  \n\nI recently opened up the product to a public beta and I\u2019d love to get some feedback (good or bad) from the reddit /r/startup audience.  \n\n**Try it out here: http://www.trybetty.com**\n\n1. What do you think of the product?\n\n2. What is the one feature would you like it to have?\n\n3. By its nature it spreads, but how would you go about getting the word out about it?\n\nThanks in advance!", "likes": null, "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1zqgmv", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "author": "thewojo", "media": null, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh26", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 3, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/startups/comments/1zqgmv/app_feedback_wanted_a_new_way_of_scheduling/", "name": "t3_1zqgmv", "created": 1394156676.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1zqgmv/app_feedback_wanted_a_new_way_of_scheduling/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "App Feedback Wanted: A new way of scheduling", "created_utc": 1394127876.0, "ups": 7, "num_comments": 3, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.startups", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "startups", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the Internet History Podcast...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/2014/03/chapter-1-supplemental-1-an-interview-with-lou-montulli/\"&gt;http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/2014/03/chapter-1-supplemental-1-an-interview-with-lou-montulli/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "From the Internet History Podcast...\n\nhttp://www.internethistorypodcast.com/2014/03/chapter-1-supplemental-1-an-interview-with-lou-montulli/", "likes": null, "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1zqkng", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "author": "west80th", "media": null, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh26", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "saved": false, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/startups/comments/1zqkng/in_honor_of_the_upcoming_20th_anniversary_of/", "name": "t3_1zqkng", "created": 1394158896.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1zqkng/in_honor_of_the_upcoming_20th_anniversary_of/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "In honor of the upcoming 20th Anniversary of Netscape - An interview with employee #9, Lou Montulli", "created_utc": 1394130096.0, "ups": 3, "num_comments": 0, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.startups", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "startups", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically something like what Launchrock offers but without having to use their landing pages.
