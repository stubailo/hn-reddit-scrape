I have ideas for things and have been back on medication for ADD and since then I've been able to execute more  projects than I used to in the past but I still feel like a screwup because I can't find gainful work.\n\nI'm having a career crisis and feeling like a failure and need some guidance. Is there such thing as someone who is an \"idea\" guy, where that doesn't sound like some throwaway bullshit job title? \n\nTL:DR; I generate a ton of ideas and feel stuck in my career, or lack of career. I have grandiose ideas about maybe funding companies, or making things, but I dont really have any direction in my life when it comes to my career.
