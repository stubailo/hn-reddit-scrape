The Face Behind Bitcoin  Satoshi Nakamoto is    Satoshi Nakamoto
Rodolfo Coinkite s CEO   Newsweek Great way of destroying a mans life with unsubstantiated evidence  looking forward to your Chapter 11 filling   fail  bitcoin  
Video of Satoshi Nakamoto   No questions right now  I want my free lunch   I m not involved in Bitcoin  via Buzzfeed s Hunter Schwarz
Thank you  Satoshi Nakamoto
Remember  there s no proof in the Newsweek article 
Satoshi Nakamoto    according to Newsweek
If you believe the report about Satoshi Nakamoto s identity look at this

Important announcement for US Vault of Satoshi customers
No Satoshi look out behind you 
Newsweeks just removed the photo of  SN s  house from the article for fear of being sued  Too bad the internet is forever 
apparently Nakamoto and an AP reporter are driving around being chased by media
It s crazy to think our community can ignore the Satoshi story and make the press do the same     instead we help him
Leah McGrath Goodman posts verified proof of Satoshi s identity 
Chased old man believed to be Satoshi Nakamoto DENIES being the creator of Bitcoin  He claims he just spoke with an AP reporter  for a free lunch 
The Newsweek article is probably incorrect  Look at this 
Bitstamp Audit Proves it was Behind the  147m Mystery Bitcoin Wallet
Just got off the phone with a major international organization focused on global public health  fighting malaria  meningitis  influenza  I told them if they accepted Bitcoin  they would get global attention  pay no credit card fees  and they would help their stakeholders  This may happen soon 
I can t believe the man that wrote this is Satoshi

The Face Behind Bitcoin  Satoshi Nakamoto is    Satoshi Nakamoto
Video of Satoshi Nakamoto   No questions right now  I want my free lunch   I m not involved in Bitcoin  via Buzzfeed s Hunter Schwarz
Rodolfo Coinkite s CEO   Newsweek Great way of destroying a mans life with unsubstantiated evidence  looking forward to your Chapter 11 filling   fail  bitcoin  
AP  Dorian Nakamoto denies that he s Satoshi Nakamoto  the creator of Bitcoin
Thank you  Satoshi Nakamoto
Remember  there s no proof in the Newsweek article 
If you believe the report about Satoshi Nakamoto s identity look at this
Important announcement for US Vault of Satoshi customers

Satoshi Nakamoto    according to Newsweek
Journalist Harrasses Man Believing Him to be Bitcoin Founder Satoshi Nakamoto
No Satoshi look out behind you 
Chased old man believed to be Satoshi Nakamoto DENIES being the creator of Bitcoin  He claims he just spoke with an AP reporter  for a free lunch 
apparently Nakamoto and an AP reporter are driving around being chased by media
Newsweeks just removed the photo of  SN s  house from the article for fear of being sued  Too bad the internet is forever 
It s crazy to think our community can ignore the Satoshi story and make the press do the same     instead we help him
Leah McGrath Goodman posts verified proof of Satoshi s identity

The Newsweek article is probably incorrect  Look at this 
Just got off the phone with a major international organization focused on global public health  fighting malaria  meningitis  influenza  I told them if they accepted Bitcoin  they would get global attention  pay no credit card fees  and they would help their stakeholders  This may happen soon 
I can t believe the man that wrote this is Satoshi 
The Newsweek article is wrong about Satoshi
