Thank you  Satoshi Nakamoto
Remember  there s no proof in the Newsweek article 
Satoshi Nakamoto    according to Newsweek
No Satoshi look out behind you 
Journalist Harrasses Man Believing Him to be Bitcoin Founder Satoshi Nakamoto
It s crazy to think our community can ignore the Satoshi story and make the press do the same     instead we help him
Newsweeks just removed the photo of  SN s  house from the article for fear of being sued  Too bad the internet is forever 
The Newsweek article is probably incorrect  Look at this 
I can t believe the man that wrote this is Satoshi 
The Newsweek article is wrong about Satoshi 
Upcoming Version of Bitcoinj Software Will Use Tor Network
If you believe the report about Satoshi Nakamoto s identity look at this
CEO of the Dollar found dead after having an affair with the President of the Euro  who is the sister of the King of the Yen 
Dorian S  Nakamoto either isn t the bitcoin founder  or he is massively trolling the internet with his Amazon com reviews 
Just got off the phone with a major international organization focused on global public health  fighting malaria  meningitis  influenza  I told them if they accepted Bitcoin  they would get global attention  pay no credit card fees  and they would help their stakeholders  This may happen soon
